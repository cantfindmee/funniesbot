# the funnies bot

litterally like the only bot that is open source and easy to install

just put your token into catapi.env like this

token = "token"
catapikey = "catapikey"


and make an Admin role for your admins

and set your warns channel with the config command

llama 3.2 might not install because meta is stupid so just do it yourself

thats it</br>
i guess
